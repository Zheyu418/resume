	<h2 id="gotoArticle1">Cultural Appropriation in the Media: A Critical Analysis of Western Misrepresentation of Asian Cultures</h2>
	<p>Whenever we look at social media, there are tons of variations and combinations of cultural elements from different societies. That is the outcome of the blending between cultures, which brings more vitality and diversity to the world and better connects people from different parts. However, with a deeper level and a wider range of such communication, cultural appropriation is more and more commonly exhibited in our lives, especially the one of Chinese and Eastern cultures by Western society. </p>
 	<p><em><a href="image/natashadenona.jpeg" target = "_blank">The first image</a></em> is a screenshot from Natasha Denona's eyeliner tutorial for Asians with hooded eyes, but the model in the video does not have hooded eyes. As observed in the model's pre-makeup eyes, it is evident that she has double eyelids and a visible sign of double eyelids at the outer corner of her eyes. Her eye shape is not the stereotypical Asian hooded eye. However, Denona fills the gap between the model's eyelids with eyeliner so that the original shape of her eyes is not obvious at all. This type of eyeliner is common in races with angular facial features, who are much better suited for it than Asians. However, in this Asian model's face, this type of eyeliner does not serve the primary function of the makeup- it does not make her look nicer with this eyeliner. In other words, Denona applies the Western way of eyeliner to an Asian. The model seems stereotypical after putting on the eyeliner.</p>
 	<p>Next, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29AfMJymGu8" target="_blank">the video</a></em> Eat with Chopsticks is from the Dolce&Gabbana Show 2018 advertising video in Shanghai. The video is about a female model who uses chopsticks to eat Italian food under the direction of a male narrator, but the video does not correctly introduce chopsticks and their culture. When the model shows an exaggerated look and uses chopsticks like cutlery, the narrator calls chopsticks little sticks in a condescending tone and calls the Italian food "great" pizza. According to the model's facial expression and the narrator's speaking style, the model is presented ignorantly and not exposed to Western culture.</p>
	<p>Lastly, <em><a href="image/diorshow.png" target = "_blank">the image</a></em> is from the Dior 2019 Vintage Show. The model is wearing a costume similar to the outfits of Chinese Peking Opera, accompanied by typical Chinese Peking Opera background music. The costume contains many elements that do not appear simultaneously in Peking Opera's rule: the symbol representing "joy" in Chinese, the dragon robe, and the clouds. Those elements have different meanings, and in Chinese culture, people pay attention to the symbols on clothes and the situation to wear clothes with those symbols. The model's face is painted extremely pale while her lips are sealed with red tape, which is a wrong presentation of Peking Opera makeup-Lianpu. Her excessively long nails are a false representation of Chinese Qing culture.</p>
	<p>In the three media documents I have chosen, there is a common issue: the misrepresentation and cultural appropriation of Asian culture by Western societies. Denona, D&G, and Dior fail to understand and present East Asian culture, especially Chinese culture. In Conley's words, culture is the sum of the social categories and concepts people embrace and practice. Cultures are socially learned and shared and vary in different contexts. People usually do not embrace and practice the culture out of their context; in this way, they learn and understand other cultures when we blend those sharings, which is the process of cultural diffusion. It is mentioned in the lecture that cultural appropriation and appreciation is another form of diffusion that can happen when a more dominant society adopts some marginal society's artifacts and habits; in other words, it is usually the misrepresentation of a minority group by a dominant culture. Cultural diffusion is one of the sources of cultural changes, and both dominant culture and marginal culture in the case of culture diffusion would be affected.</p>

	<h2 id="gotoArticle2">Durkheim's Pioneering Insights: Unveiling Social Existence, Solidarity, and Facts</h2>
	<p>As one of the founding fathers of the modern discipline of sociology, Emile Durkheim made a significant contribution to the development of sociology by unlocking the secrets of social existence and distinguishing sociology as a unique scientific discipline from other academic subjects.</p>
	<p>Durkheim indicates that two contrasting types of society exist, which result in different solidarity in each society. First, he points out that in a small, simple, undifferentiated community where members are independent but share a lot in common, including thinking and acting, they share strong sentiments and hold collective conscience with each other. In this way, society is united and sustained through namely mechanical solidarity produced among homogeneous communities, and individuals are directly subject to society without any agencies. While a society with mechanical solidarity could integrate members by letting them feel connected through religion, it is easy to break. And repressive law is appropriate for it, as the law will tend to protect and maintain the same characteristics among members in the society, and penal assumes that all people are the same in their own right. Even though Durkheim may infer that mechanical solidarity exists more in less-evolved societies, it could decrease internal conflict, bias, and competition in the short term by emphasizing uniformity and homogeneity.</p>
	<p>However, there would be a change when a mechanically solidary society is no longer able to sustain itself by sharing homogenous since the out of certain subsistence; thus, the development of diversity is on the way due to society will adapt the new structure. We are in the step of organic solidarity, in which societies coerce members through diversity and specialization, such as the division of labor by playing different roles. Like organs of different functions are combined to form a whole, members don't share as much as the conscience collective in this type of society, but the interdependence level essentially increases, and the law tends to be more restitutive. In the process of transformation of mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity (traditional society to modern society), the old value system gradually collapses, and anomie occurs. 
	Under mechanical solidarity, people are still individual pieces of firewood, but they are formed into heaps, while organic solidarity is a ripple by throwing stones into the water, expanding outward as a circle, closely connected to the center and each individual. It is not hard to find examples of both types of solidarity in the process of societies, but it is hard for us to realize its existence when we are following and obligated to the adaption to society itself. When the division of labor inevitably brings anomie in societies, we members are constrained in this evolution without awareness of social change. Individuals can't return to a mechanically solidary society no matter whether the will is powerful and universal because society is not simply the aggregate of individuals in that situation. It is indeed an independent reality.</p>
	<p>Let's move to the social fact, which is the object of sociological study according to Durkheim, is something in society that exerts a certain effect on individual members and forces them to behave in a certain way. It is something out of individual consciousness and something concrete. To my understanding, it could be a religion, a tradition, a cultural atmosphere, and anything else that somehow influences our behavior and controls us. Still, social facts are universal rather than the individual; but this thing is not in the realm of economics, nor is it a biological human and physiological need. Durkheim's argument on the "social fact" actually encourages us to question more about things we used to take for granted, such as "why do people have these ideas?" and "why does society have these customs?" Also, a fact could only be explained by another social fact. As Durkheim mentions, social facts are constrained and coercive, and I consider them a kind of social pressure to force individuals to comply with them. If individual members do not accept them, they may be subject to, for example, formal legal arrest or informal moral opinion to show the coercion of this social pressure on individuals.</p>
	<p>As a founding father of sociology, Durkheim borrows some ideas from other subjects like biology, philosophy, and economics to apply a logically reasonable argument toward societies. It shows sociology's unique and distinctive charm as a decentralized and interdisciplinary study object nowadays.</p>

	<h2 id="gotoArticle3">Marx's Critical Analysis: Unraveling the Core of Capitalism</h2>
	<p>To Marx, private property is crucial in a capitalist society. Based on the lecture, capitalism is a system of wage labor where the means of production are privately owned and the product is appropriated as private property. In a society with a capitalist system, workers must sell or rent their labor for subsistence and survival, because those who don’t own the private property must sell their labor power to get wages from those who own the private property to survive. Private property owners appropriate the product from workers to their own property, and profits of the products go to the owners not the people who produce them since they will only receive wages. For example, proletariat workers produce products for the factory owner, they get paid from the factory owner, and the owner gets profits from selling the products. To Marx’s understanding of capitalism, private property and profits are crucial to understand what capitalism is. Therefore, one thing that differs capitalism from feudalism is that there is no profit in the term of money being in a feudalist society. In a feudal society, peasants are still able to use the item they produce, such as crops, but in a capitalist society, all the products produced by workers belong to the owners of factories/corporations. Marx believed that capitalism is greatly driven by profits, also known as surplus value, which is the difference between the selling price and the cost of production. Whenever the selling price is over the cost, there is a profit, and Marx also regards it as exploitation, since only a small group of people can have profits. It's a fundamentally exploitative relationship between bourgeoisie and proletariat. So what makes capitalism, basically, is ‘sin qua non’/surplus value/profit/exploitation. And while a capitalist society is progressing, industrialization comes with new technology, Marx thought it is a process to benefit those who own the means of production, rather than to benefit social wealth for the whole society.</p>
	<p>Marx had several critiques of capitalism, and he also disagreed with some economic ideas that supported the existence of capitalism, such as liberal economy and political economy. Marx objects with liberalism and political economy that private property in a capitalist society is natural, universal, and good. He believes that private property is either natural and universal, and only good for a very small portion of people in society, as the existence of private property denies the benefits to others except owners. He also does not think private property can motivate people to produce wealth, instead, he claims that private property harms social relations and produces conflicts, alienation, and inequality among different classes.</p>
	<p>Marx's criticism of capitalism is not simply a wholesale denial of it, nor is it an evaluation of the negative effects that individual entrepreneurs or capitalists have on people. He was making a very critical analysis of capitalist society. Marx argues that capitalism inherently, intrinsically, and internally creates structural pressure on proletariats in order to increase profits constantly, and in such a process, those poor people will be poorer in the capitalist society because the owners always compete with each other to maximize their own profits. Marx believes that, in the capitalist world, there is always intrinsic and internal pressure to increase profits, and increasing profits leads to increasing impoverishment as one way to increase profits is to exploit workers financially.</p>
	<p>Another critique links with alienation, as Marx suggests that the mode of capitalist production makes people feel disconnected from one another, and it is the way how capitalism harms social relations. Also, when a capitalist society evolves with increasing fetishization, human characteristics will be gradually replaced by physical money, which means capitalism tries to measure the value of things and people in terms of money, while ignoring its own characteristics.</p> 
	<p>Marx believed that capitalism will eventually collapse, because there is inherent and internal contradiction of capitalism, which is the tension between bourgeoisie and proletariat, the structural and intrinsic tendency for capitalism to increase poverty due to the competition/pressure of profits, and capitalism has booms and busts without predictability.</p>
